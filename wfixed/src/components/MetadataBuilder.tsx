There could be several reasons why the transaction sent by #69 is reverting. One possible reason is that there is an issue with the smart contract's mint function in the `/api/mint` endpoint.

To investigate further, you can check the following:

1. Check the code for the `/api/mint` endpoint and make sure that it is properly handling the minting of NFTs. Verify that all required parameters are being passed correctly to the mint function in the smart contract.

2. Check the logs and error messages from the smart contract. If there are any error messages or revert reasons provided by the smart contract, it can help identify the specific issue causing the transaction to revert.

3. Check the smart contract's code for any potential issues. Look for any require or assert statements that might be causing the revert. Make sure that any preconditions for the mint function are met (e.g., ownership, availability of tokens, etc.).

4. Verify the network and contract addresses being used. Make sure that the smart contract being interacted with is deployed correctly and on the intended network.

5. Check the transaction details, such as gas limit and gas price. Make sure that the gas limit is set appropriately to accommodate the execution of the mint function.

By investigating these areas, you should be able to find the reason for the transaction reverting and take the necessary steps to fix it.
